          As winter sinks its teeth into Edmonton, time feels stalled and every street carries the echo of something lost. People move through it half-awake, tethered to memory, haunted by what might have been.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          <strong>Every Light in Every Window, Every Tooth in Every Mouth</strong> is a novel of grief and inheritance, of how love lingers and fractures, of how the past bends the present in ways we can’t escape. It asks whether we are bound to repeat ourselves—or if change is ever truly possible.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Told in luminous fragments, it captures the ache of longing, the distortions of memory, and the quiet gravity of lives brushing against each other in a city that only pretends it’s awake.

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>
          Tanner Waldo lives in Edmonton, Alberta, and was raised in Sylvan Lake, where long winters and quiet nights left space for reflection. His work explores memory, longing, and the quiet distortions of grief—writing toward the ache in things that are missing, shifting, or half-forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he’s not writing, he volunteers at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival and is learning to kayak, though often in slow circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Every Light in Every Window, Every Tooth in Every Mouth</em> is his first novel.
