          Set in Edmonton as winter’s teeth sink in, Tanner Waldo’s debut novel explores grief, memory, 
          and emotional inheritance in a city that no longer feels like what it was. People drift through it—tired, 
          uncertain, hoping something will change but unsure if it ever really does.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Julian walks that city like a half-remembered dream. His tumour is back, his relationships are frayed, 
          and every street seems to echo with what he’s lost. Lena serves coffee to strangers while grieving a man 
          she wasn’t finished loving. Adrienne stands at the edge of a marriage she no longer believes in. 
          And Hugh, raised to swallow every emotion, begins to question the quiet burdens passed down by the men in his life.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          In a city that pretends it’s awake, five lives edge toward, and away from, each other. Told in luminous, 
          fragmented moments, <em>Every Light in Every Window, Every Tooth in Every Mouth</em> is a quiet descent 
          through winter and selfhood—an aching portrait of people trying to outrun the weight of who they used to be.

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>
          Tanner Waldo lives in Edmonton, Alberta, and was raised in Sylvan Lake, where long winters and quiet nights left space for reflection. His work explores memory, longing, and the quiet distortions of grief—writing toward the ache in things that are missing, shifting, or half-forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he’s not writing, he volunteers at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival and is learning to kayak, though often in slow circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Every Light in Every Window, Every Tooth in Every Mouth</em> is his first novel.
