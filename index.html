          Set in Edmonton as winter’s teeth sink in, Tanner Waldo’s debut novel explores grief, memory, 
          and emotional inheritance in a city that no longer feels like what it was. People drift through it—tired, 
          uncertain, hoping something will change but unsure if it ever really does.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Julian walks that city like a half-remembered dream. His tumour is back, his relationships are frayed, 
          and every street seems to echo with what he’s lost. Lena serves coffee to strangers while grieving a man 
          she wasn’t finished loving. Adrienne stands at the edge of a marriage she no longer believes in. 
          And Hugh, raised to swallow every emotion, begins to question the quiet burdens passed down by the men in his life.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          In a city that pretends it’s awake, five lives edge toward, and away from, each other. Told in luminous, 
          fragmented moments, <em>Every Light in Every Window, Every Tooth in Every Mouth</em> is a quiet descent 
          through winter and selfhood—an aching portrait of people trying to outrun the weight of who they used to be.
